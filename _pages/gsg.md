**Installing Software and Getting Connected to a Roaster**

Determine what connection devices you have.  Mine had a 1048 Phidget
!https://www.phidgets.com/?tier=3&catid=14&pcid=12&prodid=38

First install the Phidgets Software Drivers
!https://www.phidgets.com/docs/Software_Overview

Then you need to install Artisan
!https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan

On a PC, the installer will first remove your prior version but this won’t remove your prior settings if you have them.  On a MAC, your settings will be saved as well.  You can also downgrade to a previous version by just uninstalling the current version and re-installing the old version without losing any settings.  On a MAC, you will get a warning that Artisan is from an unidentified developer.  That is being worked on but go to Settings>Security and Privacy, and you will be able to allow Artisan to install.  NOTE, we still advise you to save stable settings before changing any settings or installing a new version (Help>Save Settings).
