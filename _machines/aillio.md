* __Producer:__ [Aillio Limited](https://aillio.com), Taiwan
* __Machine:__ Bullet R1
* __Connection:__ vendor specific USB protocol
* __Features:__ 
  - logging of drum temperature (DT), bean temperature (BT), exhaust temperature, BT rate-of-rise curves, and voltage

**Watch out!** For best performance, please start monitoring the
roaster before pre-heating.  Artisan doesn't monitor unsafe
temperatures, so you should never leave the roaster alone.

**Watch out!** Running Artisan in parallel with another roast logging software, like RoastTime, connected to the same machine might lead to unstabilities and crashes.
