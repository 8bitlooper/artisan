## Upgrading Artisan

Download and install the latest version of Artisan](https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan).

The installer, on a MAC or PC, will first remove your prior version but this wonâ€™t remove your prior settings if you have them. You can also downgrade to a previous version by just uninstalling the current version and re-installing the old version without losing any settings.  On a MAC, you will get a warning that Artisan is from an unidentified developer.  That is being worked on but go to Settings>Security and Privacy, and you will be able to allow Artisan to install.  NOTE, save your stable settings before changing any settings or installing a new version (Help>Save Settings).
