## Upgrading Artisan

Download and install the latest version of [Artisan](https://github.com/artisan-roaster-scope/artisan/releases/latest).

The installer, on a MAC or PC, will first remove your prior version but this wonâ€™t remove your prior settings if you have them. You can also downgrade to a previous version by just uninstalling the current version and re-installing the old version without losing any settings.    

To ensure no issues, save your stable settings before changing any settings or installing a new version (Help>Save Settings).
More complete instructions on the [installations page](/_docs/02-installation.md).
