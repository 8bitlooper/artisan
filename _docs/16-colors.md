### Colors and Color Themes

New color themes and color management options are available in 1.3.  Themes are new.  They contain a color set that affects how the display appears.  Artisan comes with several built-in themes that are both attractive and useful as example starting point for user defined themes.  The built-in themes are available at Config>Themes>Artisan.  A user can save a theme by clicking Help>Save Theme. User saved themes can be loaded from Config>Themes>User.  Themes affect only the display on the screen.  They do not affect any of the other Artisan settings.  Note that themes are a subset of the Artisan settings saved and loaded from the Help menu.

Almost every color used in Artisan can now be configured.  All these colors are saved in themes.  If your foreground and background colors are too similar you will get a message to check them out.  

Also new are enhanced dialogs that display the chosen colors within the dialog.
