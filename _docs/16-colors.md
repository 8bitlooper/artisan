### Colors and Color Themes

New color themes and color management options are available in 1.3.  

Almost every color used in Artisan can now be configured.  All these colors are saved in themes.  If your foreground and background colors are too similar you will get a message to check them out.  

Also new are enhanced dialogs that display the chosen colors within the dialog.
