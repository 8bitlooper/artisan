### Readings

Menu>View>Readings

 This turns on the small LCD panels on the right side that read the ET, BT and Delta ET and BT (rate of rise).  These are key readings you will use during the roast.  You can toggle on a separate LCD under Menu>View>LCD and you can also toggle Full Screen off under Menu>View>Full Screen.  The keyboard shortcuts vary by operating system.
