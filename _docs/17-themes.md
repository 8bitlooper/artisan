### Color Themes

Menu>Config>Themes

Themes are new.  They contain a color set that affects how the display appears.  Artisan comes with several built-in themes that are both attractive and useful as example starting point for user defined themes.  The built-in themes are available at Config>Themes>Artisan.  A user can save a theme by clicking Help>Save Theme. User saved themes can be loaded from Config>Themes>User.  Themes affect only the display on the screen.  They do not affect any of the other Artisan settings.  Note that themes are a subset of the Artisan settings saved and loaded from the Help menu.
