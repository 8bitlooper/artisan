### Roast Properties Dialog

Under the Roast Properties, you can input many parameters for your current batch and you can choose a Profile to run in the background.

When you enter the coffee bean name here, it shows up on the graph.  To save them hit the + sign to the right of the name.  You can add notes about the beans, and the roaster.  With weight and volume entered, density can be calculated.  You can note moisture as well if you know it.  On the second tab Notes, you can add roasting and cupping notes.  Events and Data are entered by Artisan when the roast is done.

To reset the Properties you have to select the box “Delete roast properties on RESET” and then reset. You can also have the Properties box open on charge to remind you, mostly to at least, name your coffee.


*Density calculations*

Two blog posts on the density calculations [here](
https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.de/2014/11/batch-volume-and-bean-density.html) and [here](http://kostverlorenvaart.blogspot.nl/2014/12/lose-weight-gain-volume-about-coffee.html).

You need a beaker that is smaller than your batch size for this calculator.  You will put in your unit of measurement at the top (say a 400ml beaker), and then you put in your pre and post roast weights to fill that measure of beans on the left. The calculator takes your actual weight in and out from the Roast Properties and places in the right hand boxes.    The calculator will return the density both pre and post roast using the actual pre and post grams.  I think it might be easier to just measure 400grm and check the line on a beaker pre and post roast; however if you don’t do these steps the density won’t show up on the roast report.  Once you know the density of the bean you are using there is shortcut. Assume you know the bean’s density you can enter the known density in the Density field within the roast properties, select the correct density weight (e.g. grams) and volume units (e.g. one liter – but 1 in the box).  Put the cursor in the Volume field after putting in the weight and press the Enter key. Artisan will take the specified density and batch weight of the greens and compute the volume for you.
