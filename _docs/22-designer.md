### Designer

Menu>Tools>Designer

Designer allows you to create a model roast profile.

To save a profile created in designer mode, go to Tools>Designer and untick the Designer menu item, and you are left with a regular profile that you can save as any other one.

In order to create a smooth curve, you have to add data points and drag the profile line into place by grabbing one point at a time to adjust it.   You can also import a profile into Designer that I you actually roasted; however, Designer extrapolates the curve from recorded Events in the profile and it wonâ€™t look like your exact profile.  

So, if the original curve is this:

It imports into Artisan by selecting from the top menu, Tools --> Designer. Designer warns you that you'll get something different.

And the result is certainly different.

The only way to get the curve close to the original, reflecting the performance of your roaster, is to right click on the curve to add a point, giving this menu.

After adding points and moving them around, you can design your intended profile, including manipulating the ROR curve, which only happens as a result of changes made in the BT curve you design. But then you must deselect the Designer tool to save the profile as you would any other. It can then be loaded into the background and used to guide an intended roast.
