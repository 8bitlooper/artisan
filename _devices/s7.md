Artisan can be configured to read from up to 8 channels from a Siemens S7 PLC. Per channel, the S7 area, database, register and data type (integer or float) can be configured

The PID mechanism provided by the Siemens S7 PLC can be connected to the Artisan PID controls similar as in the MODBUS case (see the post on [PID support](https://artisan-roasterscope.blogspot.it/2016/11/pid-control.html) for details).
